        THE UCHIHA CLAN

        The Uchiha are descendants of Indra Ōtsutsuki, the elder son of Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki. Through Indra, the Uchiha
        inherited Hagoromo's "eyes", granting them powerful spiritual energy and chakra. As part of the so-called "Curse
        of Hatred" first displayed by Indra, Uchiha are subject to powerful emotions: these emotions typically start as
        love for a friend or family member that then become overpowering hatred when the object of their love is lost.
        This loss, whether actually experienced or merely threatened, awakens an Uchiha's Sharingan. It is due to the
        Sharingan that the Uchiha have received much of their fame and notoriety. <br>

        The Uchiha have been fighting the Senju clan for centuries, a rivalry that traces back to the days of Indra and
        his younger brother, Asura. When the Sage of Six Paths was dying, he selected Asura as his successor, believing
        Asura's desire for peace through love was better than Indra's peace through power. Indra, driven by his Curse of
        Hatred, fought Asura to claim what he believed was his birthright. The Uchiha and Senju, descendants of Indra
        and Asura respectively, continued their battle through the centuries, though none still remembered this reason
        for their conflict. <br>
        By the time of the Warring States Period, the Uchiha and Senju had emerged as the strongest shinobi clans in the
        world. When one of the fledgling countries of the era would hire the Uchiha to fight in their wars, the opposing
        side would hire the Senju.[4] The constant warfare between their clans only fuelled their hatred, with all
        Uchiha owing the death of a loved one to a Senju and vice versa. But centuries of conflict began to wear on
        members of the clans; Madara Uchiha and Hashirama Senju met as children and became friends, bonding over their
        disapproval of the combat and death that they and their younger brothers were constantly subjected to and
        dreaming of a time when children wouldn't need to fight. Unable to do anything about the world at their age,
        Madara turned away from their dreams. <br>
        Madara and Hashirama continued to face each other in battle over the coming years. Driven by his desire to
        defeat Hashirama and through competition with his younger brother, Izuna, Madara became the first Uchiha to
        awaken his Mangekyō Sharingan. With its increased power he took control of the Uchiha. Hashirama, by then leader
        of the Senju, tried to use their positions to broker peace between them and finally achieve their childhood
        dreams. Despite growing interest in peace amongst the Uchiha, Madara was unwilling to agree to peace after Izuna
        was killed by Hashirama's brother, Tobirama. Using Izuna's eyes to acquire "eternal" Mangekyō, Madara challenged
        the Senju for supremacy one final time.[5] He was defeated, but even then refused Hashirama's offer of peace,
        insisting that Hashirama kill himself first. When Hashirama agreed to these terms, Madara was moved to accept,
        withdrawing his request for Hashirama's death.
